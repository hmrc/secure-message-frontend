## Run the project locally 

`sbt "run 9055 -Dplay.http.router=testOnlyDoNotUseInAppConf.Routes"`

## Run the tests and sbt fmt before raising a PR

Ensure you have service-manager python environment setup:

`source ../servicemanager/bin/activate`

Format:

`sbt fmt`

Then run the tests and coverage report:

`sbt clean coverage test coverageReport`

If your build fails due to poor testing coverage, *DO NOT* lower the test coverage, instead inspect the generated report located here on your local repo: `/target/scala-2.12/scoverage-report/index.html`

Then run the integration tests:

`sbt it:test`
